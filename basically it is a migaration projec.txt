basically it is a migaration project :

they are changing the technologies to new version 
for example they used before SSIS MDX Excel pivotes like kind of technoliges.

now they are moving in to azure cloud platform
now they are using data lake for warehouse then data bricks,
power bi, report builder, tabuler editor.

then before they used 1 model for every category thats means HR delivery finance like those are in one model 

now they split in sepratly.

then they added one another model name called " "
that model is creted by me that is same as delivery model
some attributes and measures needs to add

then i created some dashbord also.. my RM will explaine the requirment so i will follow those and i will create it but i dont have access to deployed it so she will review the dashboard and if there any issue she will find then i need to correct it.
thats it 

then i worked with DAX and MDX queries
they used MDX before now they are using DAX so i convert the MDX views to DAX and same thing with store porocedures


last time i try to created the CI/CD using git action for the powerbi workspace
